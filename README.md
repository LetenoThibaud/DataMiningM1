# DataMiningM1
## TODO : 
	- decision tree
	- regression logistic
	- 
	- feature selection (Xi2 + test de fisher + acp) 
	- oversample minority class / undersample majority class
	- create synthetic data
	- on the two previous points -> SVM
	- evaluate with the F-measure + accuracy

	-> a possibility is to forget about the feature selection by doing decision tree + logistic regression with feature selection (in it)
